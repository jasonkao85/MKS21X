###10-24-16: variable types

Hierarchy: Agent-->Ship-->Enemy,EnemyBomber
``` 
Agent orange = new Agent();  
Ship tipton = new Ship();  
Enemy mine = new Enemy();  
```
An object variable can refer to an instance of itself or one of its subclasses
```
Agent x, y;  
Ship z;

x = orange; // allowed, b/c referring to instance of itself
y = tipton; // allowed, b/c referring to instance of its subclass
z = orange // not allowed, b/c Agent is higher on the hierarchy
```
An object is the reference (type), but its instance can be a subclass
```
Agent y = tipton; // agent reference, but ship instance
(Ship) y; // legal, explained below
```
Typecasting: we can type cast y ONLY b/c it has info from Ship tipton.
